Phase 1

Hi Astro Pi, Raspberry Pi and Principia,

Short Introduction


I (Nuex) really wants to be able to code an educational app about space! We will have two settings which will be a child and adult setting. This will be good as we will have a virtual tour around a space station, a countdown, a temperature detector and fun facts. We hope you continue to read to see the detailed explanation!

Detailed Description

In our app we will have loads of fun facts, video’s and games. The games will be copy of jelly splash but will have a space theme. On the Astro Pi board we will use the sensors so every time you move it, it will rotate the image so you can see it. Also on the virtual tour you will need to rotate to look around. Tim will be able to use the app so that he can pass by time and see the temperature. This is good because he doesn’t have to sit through a long flight or through boring times in the space station when he is doing nothing and it will educate him on more things about space. The code will be tested by students and teachers at Huntington School so that I have feedback and they can see if it works so that I don’t just think that. The results expected are mostly about the speed, games, facts, rotation and over all the appearance. I wouldn’t get upset if I got a couple bad comments about it because I can also fix it. We really think that this app could be important to school, homework, home use and leisure. Also all over the globe as there are many other astronauts out there and kids that would love to use this. We would tackle this by making languages setting and finally the temperature device will be good because anyone will be able to use it, even weather presenters and workers. The virtual countdown will be done through a keypad and led’s. Overall I really want to be able to code this and I thank Astro Pi, Raspberry Pi and Principia for the opportunity.
